//EXPLANATION OF MATCH
//Matches are both potential matches and definite matches
//a potential match is someone you crossed paths with, but both parties have not decided to tangle
//a definite match is another user who you have decided to tangle with and that has done the same for you
//some values are not populated until you have definitely matched with another user
